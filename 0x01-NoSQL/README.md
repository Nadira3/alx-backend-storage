# 0x01-NoSQL Project

## Description

This project is part of the `alx-backend-storage` curriculum and focuses on NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB. The tasks aim to build foundational knowledge of NoSQL concepts, MongoDB operations, and data management. By the end of this project, you should understand the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases and be able to perform basic operations in MongoDB.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of NoSQL databases and how they differ from relational (SQL) databases.
- Get familiar with MongoDB, a widely-used NoSQL database.
- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using MongoDB.
- Apply MongoDB queries to interact with and manipulate data.
- Practice designing NoSQL database structures.

## Requirements

- **MongoDB**: All tasks are based on MongoDB.
- **Mongo Shell** or **MongoDB Compass**: To interact with your MongoDB instance.
- Recommended editor: **VS Code** or any code editor of your choice.
- All `.js` files for MongoDB queries should be executable as standalone scripts.

## Project Structure

- **Task Files**: Each task has its own file for MongoDB queries or script implementation.
- **Data Models**: Example data structures for MongoDB collections.
- **README.md**: Contains documentation for each task and explanation of code where necessary.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install MongoDB**: Follow [MongoDB's official installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) to set up MongoDB on your local machine.

2. **Verify MongoDB**: Start MongoDB service and verify the installation with:
   ```bash
   mongo --version
   ```

3. Start MongoDB: Launch MongoDB with:
```
mongod
```

4. Mongo Shell: Use mongo to start MongoDBâ€™s shell or MongoDB Compass for a GUI.
