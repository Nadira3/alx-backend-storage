## Description

The ALX Backend Storage module focuses on backend storage systems, covering topics such as:
- SQL Databases
- NoSQL Databases (MongoDB)
- Database performance tuning
- Data modeling and management
- Indexing and optimization strategies
- Advanced database queries (JOINs, nested queries)
- Relationships between tables (foreign keys, normalization)
- Backup and replication strategies

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Each folder contains tasks and exercises related to specific concepts in backend storage.

### Example Directory Breakdown:
- **`0x00-SQL_Introduction`**: Basic SQL syntax, simple queries, filtering, sorting, and database manipulation.
- **`0x01-SQL_Advanced`**: More advanced SQL queries, joins, subqueries, and performance improvements.
- **`0x02-NoSQL`**: Introduction to NoSQL databases using MongoDB.
- **`0x03-ORM`**: Object-Relational Mapping, using ORMs to interact with databases.
- **`0x04-Advanced_MongoDB`**: Deeper dive into MongoDB features, including aggregation pipelines, sharding, and indexing.

## Installation

To set up the repository locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PreciousAitanun/alx-backend-storage.git
    ```

2. Install required packages (e.g., for MongoDB or SQL):

    ```bash
    # Install MongoDB
    sudo apt install mongodb

    # For SQL, you may install MySQL or PostgreSQL
    sudo apt install mysql-server
    ```

3. Set up the database by following instructions in each project directory.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project folder you're working on:

    ```bash
    cd 0x00-SQL_Introduction
    ```

2. Run your SQL queries or scripts using a database client (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).

    Example for MySQL:

    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p < query.sql
    ```

    Example for MongoDB:

    ```bash
    mongo < script.js
    ```

3. Check the outputs and debug as needed.

## Projects

Here are some highlights of the projects within this repository:

- **SQL Introduction**: Learn the basics of SQL, including creating and managing databases and tables.
- **SQL Advanced**: Dive deeper into SQL queries, working with joins, subqueries, and indexes for performance optimization.
- **NoSQL (MongoDB)**: Explore MongoDB and NoSQL concepts, focusing on document storage, querying, and aggregation.
- **ORM**: Learn how to abstract database interaction using Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like SQLAlchemy.
- **Advanced MongoDB**: Advanced MongoDB features such as indexing, replication, and sharding to handle large datasets.
